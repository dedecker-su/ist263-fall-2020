        We believe...The Son of God, Jesus Christ, became incarnate, was begotten by the Holy Ghost, born of a virgin, and is the true God and true man.<br><br>
        We believe...The Bible, in it's entirety, to be the inspired Word of 
        God and the only infallible rule of faith and conduct.<br><br>
        We believe... In the resurrection power of Jesus Christ, the eternal life of the saved, and the eternal punishment of the lost.<br><br>
        We believe... The only way of salvation is a personal relationship with Jesus Christ through His shed blood on the cross. (to be born again) Romans 10: 9,10 and John 3:3<br><br>
        We believe... In water baptism by immersion for believers according to Matthew 28:19<br><br>
        We believe... In divine healing through the power of Jesus Christ as stated in the Scriptures.<br><br>
        We believe... In the Holy Ghost by Whom believers of Jesus Christ are regenerated, baptized into Christ, indwelt, sealed, and filled for service.<br><br>
        We believe... In the Christian's hope and the imminent personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
