    <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
    <p>We believe... In only one God who is the creator of all things and being 
        in the Trinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br>
        We believe...The Son of God, Jesus Christ, became incarnate, was begotten by the Holy Ghost, born of a virgin, and is the true God and true man.<br>
        We believe...The Bible, in it's entirety, to be the inspired Word of 
        God and the only infallible rule of faith and conduct.<br>
        We believe... In the resurrection power of Jesus Christ, the eternal life of the saved, and the eternal punishment of the lost.<br>
        We believe... The only way of salvation is a personal relationship with Jesus Christ through His shed blood on the cross. (to be born again) Romans 10: 9,10 and John 3:3<br>
        We believe... In water baptism by immersion for believers according to Matthew 28:19<br>
        We believe... In divine healing through the power of Jesus Christ as stated in the Scriptures.<br>
        We believe... In the Holy Ghost by Whom believers of Jesus Christ are regenerated, baptized into Christ, indwelt, sealed, and filled for service.<br>
        We believe... In the Christian's hope and the imminent personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

    <h2>Pastor's Greeting</h2>
    <p>As the Senior Pastor of the First Baptist Church, I would like to personally extend an open invitation to whoever, regardless of wherever you come from or whatever condition you are in.  We are here to greet you with love, to treat you with respect, and to bring forth The Word of God as God has given it to us - in His Word.  We preach and we teach out of The Word of God and The Word of God only, and that's what you'll  be hearing and seeing here at The First Baptist Church.<br>- Pastor Jeffrey E. Smith</p>

    <h2>Sermons</h2>
    <p>We are so happy to be able to provide those who are home-bound, those who could not make a service, those who are searching for purpose in life, or those who are military - currently away protecting our freedoms, the opportunity to stay connected with our church.  May the Lord richly bless you and speak to you today through the preaching of His Word!</p>
